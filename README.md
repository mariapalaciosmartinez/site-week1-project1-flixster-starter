### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Learning about connecting th html file to the java script file using the DOM was extremely helpful especially when it came to functions. For example, my button to load more movie options wouldn't stay under all the movies especially when I loaded more. To solve this I had to make sure all movies were treated as one HTML section to help the movie cards obtain a dynamic nature. All movie cards were treated as one once I define a grid in the HTML file and accessed it in the java script file using .querySelector.

Learning about the fetch was also very helpful as (essentially) it allowed me to use a very extensive list without having to explicitly write it into my file. Before we learned about API's in class, we wanted to make progress so we added a Fake API file that took up unecessary space. Fetch helped me use a list of 7k+ movies without taking up additional space!

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
A feature I would like to implement is displaying streaming service where you could find the movie.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Although I did not demo my project this week, I was not planning on my previous lack of js knowledge to interfere with my coding. I was very wrong as this made me have to put in extra research to make sure I wasn't mistaking a syntax error for a logical error.

Something a peer is doing is researching js using the https://javascript.info/ page. I would like to review this over the weekend as it would be productive to spend energy on the logic instead of the syntax.

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

Sammy, an instructor, was very helpful. He got me to find the right track for creating a button that would generate more movies without explicitly giving me the answer. Instead, he reminded me of tools that I may find helpful in it's creation.
